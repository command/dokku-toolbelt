# dokku-toolbelt

Toolbelt for dokku, similar to the heroku toolbelt

## HELP, MAINTAINER WANTED.

I no longer use dokku personally and would really appreciate someone stepping up to take ownership of this project from me. If you are interested, please create an issue to put your hand up.

## Installation
```
npm install -g dokku-toolbelt
```

## Example usage

```
cd /path/to/my/dokku/app
dt config

=====> app config vars
NODE_ENV: production
```

## Help

Running `dt help` or `dt` will output the help text information

## Explanation

Dokku toolbelt essentially just proxies running the `dokku` command on servers
remotely via ssh with a little 'context aware sugar' supplied by running
`git remote -v` in the current directory and parsing out `host` and `appname`

## Context aware

The toolbelt knows from which directory you are in, which server and project you are working with.
It can determine this by using `git remote -v` and looking for the correct host by looking for a dokku@ username
and parsing out the project name from the part after the : character.

```
dokku dokku@my-host.me:my-awesome-project

# host -> my-host.me
# project -> my-awesome-project
```
